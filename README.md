# TEST Type and Media 23/24
This repository is for demonstration purpose how Git works shown by Petr van Blokland during his class on 19th of December 2023.

GitHub is normally used for code, but UFOs are text documents, therefore it is quite nice to use Git for your Typedesign Projects. Most important advantage with GitHub is the version control. If you save or update a file Git will notice a change and create a digital duplicate. You can jump back to first edition/version back if you like to. Especially nice, if you work with a team on a project.

We are doing a variable Font together using GitHub that way.
