# TEST Type and Media 23/24
This repository is for demonstration purpose how Git works shown by Petr van Blokland during his class on 19th of December 2023.

GitHub is normally used for code, but UFOs are text documents, therefore it is quite nice to use Git for your Typedesign Projects. Most important advantage with GitHub is the version control. If you save or update a file Git will notice a change and create a digital duplicate. You can jump back to first edition/version back if you like to. Especially nice, if you work with a team on a project.

We are doing a variable Font together using GitHub that way.

* generates a file that is called .gitignore, files starting with a dot are normally not visible in a folder.

* You can add to this template file your own rules, what should be ignored. For example Folders that starts with a _, like _export, _proof, _ttf, _otf, _vf .DS_Store
* The last one is quite useful if you work in a team, because while uploading your files/pulling the versions it is causing a conflict. In .DS_Store there are information stored about the user, location, etc.

Add Licence (This is mostly important for open source projects. Thus choose one, it will create a file, you can change it later, when created.
